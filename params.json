{"name":"En-data mining","tagline":"Data Mining Historical Newspaper Metadata","body":"Newspapers from European digital library collections collections are part of the data set OLR’ed (Optical Layout Recognition) by the project Europeana Newspaper (www.europeana-newspapers.eu). The OLR refinement consists of the description of the structure of each issue and articles (spatial extent, title and subtitle, classification of content types) using the METS/ALTO format.\r\n\r\nOf each digital document is derived a set of bibliographical and descriptive metadata relating to content (date of publication, number of pages, articles, words, illustrations, advertisements, etc.). Shell and XSLT scripts called with Xalan-Java are used to extract metadata from METS manifest and OCR files. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Charts\r\nSee [Charts](https://github.com/altomator/EN-data_mining/tree/master/Charts)\r\n\r\n#### Dataset\r\nThe complete set of derived data contains about 4,500,000 atomic metadata from six national and regional French newspapers (1814-1945, 880 000 pages, 150 000 issues) of Gallica (www.gallica.fr) press collections:\r\n- *Le Matin*\r\n- *Le Gaulois*\r\n- *Le Petit journal illustré*\r\n- *Le Journal des débats politiques et littéraires*\r\n- *Le Petit Parisien*\r\n- *Ouest-Eclair*\r\n\r\nSee [Datasets](https://github.com/altomator/EN-data_mining/tree/master/Datasets)\r\n\r\n#### Article\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
